This tutorial will teach you the basics of building a Flutter Website and deploying it to Firebase. This is part 1 in a 4 part series, the series we will cover:

## Contents

**Part 1: A Basic Landing Page**

- Creating the app using Stacked
- Intro to Responsive UI
- How to structure your project files
- Intro to Form Input
- Deploying a Flutter Web app

Part 2: UI Layout

- Create Persistent headers and footer
- Create a Menu / Toolbar using Navigator nesting

Part 3: Route Management

- Url specific navigation
- Back and forward nav using Back Buttons
- Basics of Route Guarding

Part 4: Improve the Flutter Web Experience

- Loading animations on start
- Intro animations when your page loads
- Hover effects for increased interactivity

## Getting Started

I build our apps and our clients apps using Stacked, it's a meta-framework that provides opinionated production patterns to your code base. Your code stays testable, maintainable and scalable for large teams. To get started we install the `stacked_cli` by running.

```shell
dart pub global activate stacked_cli
```

When installation completes we'll create our web project using the dedicated web template.

```shell
stacked create app filledstacks_academy --template=web
```

_**Warning**: Stacked doesn't control where it is installed. If `stacked` is not recognized check your path and try to install other dart packages to see if it works._

## Project Overview

Stacked provides you with a template where most of the setup has been done already. To avoid doing a deep dive into everything immediately we'll address the parts we need to achieve the goal at hand.

### Responsive Layouts

To showcase this lets start by running the app. In your terminal execute the following.

```shell
flutter run -d chrome
```

Now re-size your chrome window and you'll see the UI change between desktop (the counter UI), tablet and mobile. If you open `home_view.dart` you'll see the widget responsible for this, `ScreenTypeLayout.builder`. It allows you to build different UI's based on the current screenSize defined as mobile, tablet and desktop.

<br/>
My goal is always to have scalable code, meaning me and my team have a pattern to follow to produce high quality code, consistently. The `responsive_builder` package is the only package that place focus on creating an easily understandable responsive UI, without having multiple checks and conditional logic scattered everywhere.

## Building a Landing Page

With that brief overview we can start building the Desktop UI (Design below).

![FilledStacks Academy Desktop UI](/assets/blog/tutorials/085/01-desktop-ui.jpeg)

We'll break up the layout as follows.

<!-- ![FilledStacks Academy Desktop UI Breakdown](../images/085/02-desktop-ui-breakdown.jpeg) -->

### UI Layouts

Open `home_view.desktop.dart` where you can remove the body of the Scaffold. Set the body to a Row, the first child (Left side of screen) is a `Column` and the last child is an Image (We'll use a container for now).

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context, HomeViewModel viewModel) {
    return Scaffold(
    // Outside Row
    body: Row(
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max,
        children: [
            // Left side of screen
            Column(
                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                children: [],
            ),
            // Right side of screen
            Container(width: 450, color: Colors.amber)
        ],
    ));
}
```

Now that we have the layout we can start adding in our actual UI. Below is a per widget breakdown of the UI we are going to build.

![Flutter Desktop UI Breakdown](/assets/blog/tutorials//085/03-desktop-widget-breakdown.jpg)

Each rectangle shows a separate widget with its type in the tag next to it. You can copy the below and paste it inside the `Column` children.

```dart
// Academy Icon
const Text(
    'FilledStacks Academy',
    style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 15,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
    ),
),

// Space
const Spacer(flex: 2),

// Title
GradientText(
    'MASTER\nFLUTTER',
    style: const TextStyle(
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
        fontSize: 80,
        height: 0.95,
    ),
    colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
    ),
    const Text(
    'ON THE WEB',
    style: TextStyle(
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
        fontSize: 80,
        height: 0.95,
    ),
),

// Subtitle
Row(
    children: [
        const Text(
        'Build amazing software, the right way.',
        style: TextStyle(
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
            fontSize: 20,
        ),
        ),
        GradientText(
        ' Sign up to be notified',
        style: const TextStyle(
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
            fontSize: 20,
        ),
        colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
        )
    ],
),

verticalSpaceMedium,

// Arrow
Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 100),
    child: SvgPicture.asset('assets/sign-up-arrow.svg'),
),

verticalSpaceSmall,

Row(
    children: [
        // Input Field
        Container(
            child: const TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration.collapsed(
                hintText: 'Enter your Email',
                hintStyle: TextStyle(
                    color: Color(0xff989898),
                ),
                filled: true,
                fillColor: Color(0xFF232323),
                ),
            ),
            width: kdDesktopMaxContentWidth * 0.3,
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                horizontal: 20, vertical: 20),
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: const Color(0xFF232323),
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
            ),
        ),

        horizontalSpaceSmall,

        // Notify Button
        Container(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                horizontal: 20,
                vertical: 16,
            ),
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.white,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
            ),
            child: const Text(
                'Notify Me',
                style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.black,
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.w700,
                    fontSize: 20),
            ),
        )
    ],
),

const Spacer(flex: 3)
```

Now we have to do a few things to get this working.

1. Go to `kdDesktopMaxContentWidth` error on the TextField and import the app constants. _On the error press `Cmd`+`.` or `ctrl`+`.` and select import option._
2. Install Simple Gradient Text by running `flutter pub app simple_gradient_text` and import. Using tip from #1
3. Install Flutter SVG by running `flutter pub add flutter_svg` and import. Use tip from #1
4. Download [this svg](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/filledstacks.appspot.com/o/tutorials%2F085%2Fsign-up-arrow.svg?alt=media&token=b89bc714-c01a-43ba-bee1-2e34f3639632) file (Open link then save from the browser). Then create a new folder in the root directory called `assets` and put the file in there.
5. Open up your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the assets folder.

```yaml
---
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
```

In your terminal run `flutter run -d chrome` and you'll see a very ugly web application ðŸ˜‚

![Flutter widgets without Styling](/assets/blog/tutorials/085/04-ui-layout-complete.jpg)

UI building in a tutorial is not my favorite, I always try to keep it as compact as I can. Only one more set of UI styling left then we can move on to more fun things like responsive layouts.

### UI Styling

We'll setup all the colors before continuing. Open `app_colors.dart`, _in VS Code press `Cmd`+`p` and type `app_colors` then press enter_. We'll update the file to the following.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

const Color kcPrimaryColor = Color(0xFF9600FF);
const Color kcPrimaryColorDark = Color(0xFF300151);
const Color kcBlack = Color(0xff0A0A0A);
const Color kcDarkGreyColor = Color(0xFF1A1B1E);
const Color kcMediumGrey = Color(0xFF232323);
const Color kcLightGrey = Color(0xff989898);
const Color kcVeryLightGrey = Color(0xFFE3E3E3);
const Color kcBackgroundColor = kcBlack;

const List<Color> kgTitle = [kcTitleGradientLeft, kcTitleGradientRight];
const Color kcTitleGradientLeft = Color(0xff0CFF60);
const Color kcTitleGradientRight = Color(0xff0091FB);
```

I don't like how verbose the Flutter Theme stuff is so I use constants to store my colors. The convention I use is a `k` infront, which indicates a constant. In all my code bases I can type `k` and it'll pop up all my constants for me. The following letter indicates the constant type. Here's a few examples.

- `kc`: Color
- `kg`: Gradient
- `kts`: TextStyle
- `kd`: double

And others I make up as I need them. This makes up a constant like `kcLightGrey` which translates to "a constant of type color that is Light Grey". To get the screenshot looking better there's a only a few things we need to do.

<br/>

1. Set the background color
2. Put the content in the center of the view
3. Restrict the width of the content
4. Use the correct font (OpenSans)

1-3 is done with small updates to the build function.

```dart
return Scaffold(
      // #1
      backgroundColor: kcBackgroundColor,
      // #2
      body: Center(
        // #3
        child: SizedBox(
          width: kdDesktopMaxContentWidth,
          height: kdDesktopMaxContentHeight,
          child: Row(
            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max,
            children: [
                ...
            ]
          ),
        ),
      ),
);
```

As for #4, we'll start off by adding google fonts.

```terminal
flutter pub add google_fonts
```

Our first update is the main theme in `main.dart`. We will set that to openSans and white as default color.

```dart
MaterialApp(
    title: 'FilledStacks Academy',
    theme: Theme.of(context).copyWith(
        primaryColor: kcBackgroundColor,
        focusColor: kcPrimaryColor,
        // Use openSansTextTheme
        textTheme: GoogleFonts.openSansTextTheme().apply(
            bodyColor: Colors.white,
        ),
    ),
   ...
);
```

To keep things organized we want to create a set of shared styles. Create a new file `lib/ui/common/shared_styles.dart` where we'll put our shared styling values.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';

TextStyle get ktsTitleText => GoogleFonts.openSans(
      fontSize: 80,
      height: 0.95,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
    );

TextStyle get ktsBodyRegular => GoogleFonts.openSans(
      fontSize: 15,
    );

TextStyle get ktsBodyLarge => GoogleFonts.openSans(
      fontSize: 20,
    );

```

Now We can replace the `style` we supplied earlier with the ones we just created. Your code should look like below.

```dart
// Academy Icon
Text(
    'FilledStacks Academy',
    style: ktsBodyRegular.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w800),
),

// Title
GradientText(
    'MASTER\nFLUTTER',
    style: ktsTitleText,
    colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
),
Text(
    'ON THE WEB',
    style: ktsTitleText,
),

 // Subtitle
Row(
    children: [
        Text(
        'Build amazing software, the right way.',
        style:
            ktsBodyLarge.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
        ),
        GradientText(
        ' Sign up to be notified',
        style:
            ktsBodyLarge.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
        colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
        )
    ],
),

```

And that concludes the styling portion. Last bit of UI to complete is adding the image. We can replace the yellow container with

```dart
ClipRRect(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
    child: Image.asset(
        'assets/master-web-hero-image.png',
        width: kdDesktopMaxContentWidth * 0.4,
        height: double.infinity,
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
    ),
)
```

Download [the hero image](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/filledstacks.appspot.com/o/tutorials%2F085%2Fmaster-web-hero-image.png?alt=media&token=724f8444-03c1-4cd1-8e8f-bd2b0de4a691) and place it in the assets folder where the arrow is. Now when you run the app you should see a UI matching our original design. Easy Peasy! Let's move on.

## Responsive UI

Here is the design for the mobile UI

![Mobile UI Layout](/assets/blog/tutorials//085/05-mobile-design.jpeg)

As you can see the widgets are the same, but in a different layout. So we'll start off by refactoring each of the widgets we added into its own file so we can re-use it. We'll create a new folder at `lib/ui/view/home/` called `widgets`. _I store all my widgets that are only used in single views in a folder called widgets so its easy to know its scope and where it will be used._

### Home View Only Widgets

The first widgets we'll refactor out are the ones that will only be used in the `HomeView` for now. Starting with the title, create a new file `home_title.dart`.

```dart
class HomeTitle extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeTitle({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        GradientText(
          'MASTER\nFLUTTER',
          style: ktsTitleText,
          colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
        ),
        Text(
          'ON THE WEB',
          style: ktsTitleText,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

Then we'll move the subtitle into its own file called `home_subtitle.dart`

```dart
class HomeSubtitle extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeSubtitle({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      children: [
        Text(
          'Build amazing software, the right way.',
          style: ktsBodyLarge.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
        ),
        GradientText(
          ' Sign up to be notified',
          style: ktsBodyLarge.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
          colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
        )
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

Next up is `home_notify_button.dart`

```dart
class HomeNotifyButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final Function()? onTap;
  const HomeNotifyButton({Key? key, this.onTap}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // We're adding a Gesture detector now so we don't need to later
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: onTap,
      child: Container(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
          horizontal: 20,
          vertical: 16,
        ),
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.white,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
        ),
        child: const Text(
          'Notify Me',
          style: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.black, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700, fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

Last in line is the image widget. Create a file called `home_image.dart` and put the following code in there.

```dart
class HomeImage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeImage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ClipRRect(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      child: Image.asset(
        'assets/master-web-hero-image.png',
        width: kdDesktopMaxContentWidth * 0.4,
        height: double.infinity,
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Common Widgets

The last set of widgets are widgets that will be used throughout the app and not only in the home view. These widgets go to `lib/ui/widgets/common/`. The first one is `academy_icon.dart`.

```dart
class AcademyIcon extends StatelessWidget {
  const AcademyIcon({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(
      'FilledStacks Academy',
      style: ktsBodyRegular.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w800),
    );
  }
}
```

And the last one is our `input_field.dart`

```dart
class InputField extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController? controller; // This is extra, but we'll need it very shortly
  const InputField({Key? key, this.controller}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: TextField(
        controller: controller,
        decoration: const InputDecoration.collapsed(
          hintText: 'Enter your Email',
          hintStyle: TextStyle(
            color: Color(0xff989898),
          ),
          filled: true,
          fillColor: Color(0xFF232323),
        ),
      ),
      width: kdDesktopMaxContentWidth * 0.3,
      padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20, vertical: 20),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: const Color(0xFF232323),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This should leave `home_view.desktop.dart` looking much neater ðŸ‘Œ

```dart
Row(
    mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max,
    children: [
        Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
            const AcademyIcon(),
            const Spacer(flex: 2),
            const HomeTitle(),
            const HomeSubtitle(),

            // Arrow
            verticalSpaceMedium,
            Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 100),
                child: SvgPicture.asset('assets/sign-up-arrow.svg'),
            ),
            verticalSpaceSmall,

            Row(
                children: const [
                    InputField(),
                    horizontalSpaceSmall,
                    HomeNotifyButton()
                ],
            ),
            const Spacer(flex: 3)
        ],
        ),
        const HomeImage()
    ],
),
```

### Responsive UI

Now that the widgets are all refactored they're ready for re-use on the mobile UI. Looking at this design we see that it's now a single `Column`.

![Flutter Mobile Design Layout Breakdown](/assets/blog/tutorials//085/06-mobile-layout-breakdown.jpeg)

We can open `home_view.mobile.dart` and Organize the widgets in the order they show up in the design.

```dart
class HomeViewMobile extends ViewModelWidget<HomeViewModel> {
  const HomeViewMobile({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, HomeViewModel viewModel) {
    return Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: kcBackgroundColor,
        body: ListView(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
            horizontal: 40,
            vertical: 50,
          ),
          children: const [
            AcademyIcon(),
            verticalSpaceLarge,
            HomeTitle(),
            verticalSpaceTiny,
            HomeSubtitle(),
            verticalSpaceLarge,
            InputField(),
            verticalSpaceMedium,
            HomeNotifyButton(),
            verticalSpaceMedium,
            HomeImage(),
          ],
        ));
  }
}
```

Since we want the view to scroll, instead of using a column, we'll use a `ListView`. If you run this you'll see that the UI doesn't build. This is because `HomeImage` sets its height:`double.infinity` which means it's infinite in the list scroll direction. So we can go in and make a modification.

#### Widget Level Responsiveness

This is our first encounter with widget level responsiveness. What we'll do is return 650 on mobile and infinity for desktop. We'll do this by using a helper function `getValueForScreenType` from the `responsive_builder` package which allows you to return a value based on the screen type.

```dart
class HomeImage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeImage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ClipRRect(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      child: Image.asset(
        'assets/master-web-hero-image.png',
        width: kdDesktopMaxContentWidth * 0.4,
        // Return 650 for mobile and double.infinity on desktop
        height: getValueForScreenType<double>(
          context: context,
          mobile: 650,
          desktop: double.infinity,
        ),
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

If you're running the app make your browser window as small as it can go and you'll see the UI now looks like this.

![Mobile UI Preview](/assets/blog/tutorials//085/07-mobile-ui-preview-1.jpg)

Only 3 widget responsive changes required and this UI will be ready.

<br/>

1. Reduce title size on mobile to avoid wrapping
2. On Mobile use a `Column` for the subtitle instead of a `Row`
3. Title should center the items instead of left align

#### Reduce title size on Mobile

This we can fix simply by using fontSize 60 on mobile and 80 on desktop for the title.

```dart
class HomeTitle extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeTitle({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        GradientText(
          'MASTER\nFLUTTER',
          // Use 60 for mobile and 80 for desktop <====== #1
          style: ktsTitleText.copyWith(
            fontSize: getValueForScreenType<double>(
              context: context,
              mobile: 60,
              desktop: 80,
            ),
          ),
          colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
        ),
        Text(
          'ON THE WEB',
          // Use 60 for mobile and 80 for desktop <====== #1
          style: ktsTitleText.copyWith(
            fontSize: getValueForScreenType<double>(
              context: context,
              mobile: 60,
              desktop: 80,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

#### Use Column on Mobile and Row on Desktop

Open the `home_subtitle.dart` file. All the changes below will be in its build function. With this requirement, it's also pretty simple to solve with the responsive builder. We know the children should be exactly the same so we can store them in a list.

```dart
final children = [
    Text(
        'Build amazing software, the right way.',
        style: ktsBodyLarge.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
    ),
    GradientText(
        ' Sign up to be notified',
        style: ktsBodyLarge.copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
        colors: const [Color(0xff0CFF60), Color(0xff0091FB)],
    )
];
```

And to return a different layout for mobile and desktop we use the same `ScreenTypeLayout.builder`.

```dart
return ScreenTypeLayout.builder(
    mobile: (_) => Column(children: children),
    desktop: (_) => Row(children: children),
);
```

#### Center align children in the Title

Update the `crossAxisAlignment` to return `.start` on desktop and `.center` on mobile.

```dart
class HomeTitle extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeTitle({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: getValueForScreenType<CrossAxisAlignment>(
        context: context,
        mobile: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
        desktop: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      ),
      children: [
        ...
      ]
    );
  }
}
```

And that's literally how easy it is to do responsive UI, down to a per widget level using the `responsive_builer` package.

<br/>
The last thing to do is ensure that the tablet layout shows the desktop layout. Run the app `flutter run -d chrome` and if you change width of your browser between desktop and mobile you'll see it uses the old tablet layout on the way to mobile. To fix this we can open `home_view.dart` and remove the tablet builder.

```dart
class HomeView extends StackedView<HomeViewModel> {
  const HomeView({super.key});

  @override
  Widget builder(
    BuildContext context,
    HomeViewModel viewModel,
    Widget? child,
  ) {
    return ScreenTypeLayout.builder(
      mobile: (_) => const HomeViewMobile(),
      // <====== No more Tablet builder
      desktop: (_) => const HomeViewDesktop(),
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

By default `responsive_builder` prefers the mobile layout so things will look weird as you resize your window from desktop to mobile. To ask `responsive_builder` to prefer the desktop when no other layout is supplied, all we do is open up `main.dart` and pass `preferDesktop:true`. Now you'll see as you resize your UI you'll stay on desktop, even when it hits tablet size, then only swaps to mobile when you reach that point.

## Basics of Forms

We have a text field but we haven't hooked it up to anything. I want to give you a quick overview of how awesome forms work in Stacked:

<br/>

1. Tell Stacked which text values you'll be capturing
2. Extend the generated Form Mixin
3. Enable two way binding. This syncs the typed value to the ViewModel automatically ðŸ”¥
4. Use the values in your `ViewModel` like a inherited property.

Let's implement a form to get the users email quickly. Open `home_view.dart` where we'll add our form functionality.

```dart
// #1: Tell Stacked which text values you'll be capturing
@FormView(fields: [FormTextField(name: 'email')])
class HomeView extends StackedView<HomeViewModel>
    with $HomeView { // #2: Extend the generated form mixin

    ...
    @override
    void onViewModelReady(HomeViewModel viewModel) {
        // #3: Enable two way binding
        syncFormWithViewModel(viewModel);
    }
}
```

When you're done with this run `stacked generate` and you'll see a new file `home_view.form.dart` generated. This is where all the form code is stored. You can import that file and you should see most of the errors go away. The last thing to do is update the ViewModel, we do this by:

<br/>

1. Extending from a FormViewModel
2. Using the email value as mentioned in #4 above.

Open `home_viewmodel.dart`, you can replace the code with the following.

```dart
// #1: Extend from the FormViewModel
class HomeViewModel extends FormViewModel {
  final _dialogService = locator<DialogService>();

  void captureEmail() {
    _dialogService.showCustomDialog(
      variant: DialogType.infoAlert,
      title: 'Thanks for Signing Up',
      // #2: Use emailValue like a normal property
      description: 'Check in $emailValue for a verification email',
    );
  }
}
```

That's it for the form setup. The next thing to do is to wire the form into the UI. In Flutter a `TextField` or `FormField` requires a `TextEditingController` to keep track of what a user has entered. We have to set the controller where we use our `InputField` widget. This means a few updates to get it to the `InputField` widget.

<br/>

1. Pass the controller to the Desktop and Mobile Layouts
2. Update desktop and mobile layouts to accept controller
3. Pass the controller to the Input Field in those layouts
4. Call the capture email function when the NotifyButton is tapped

#### Pass controller to Desktop and Mobile Layouts

Open `home_view.dart` where we can now pass the `emailController` to the two layouts.

```dart
@FormView(fields: [FormTextField(name: 'email')])
class HomeView extends StackedView<HomeViewModel> with $HomeView {
  HomeView({super.key});

  @override
  Widget builder(
    BuildContext context,
    HomeViewModel viewModel,
    Widget? child,
  ) {
    return ScreenTypeLayout.builder(
      mobile: (_) => HomeViewMobile(controller: emailController), // #1
      desktop: (_) => HomeViewDesktop(controller: emailController), // #1
    );
  }

  ...
}
```

Then we need to update the layout widgets to accept the `TextEditingController` and pass it to the `InputField` widget.

```dart
// #2: Update desktop and mobile layouts to accept controller
class HomeViewDesktop extends ViewModelWidget<HomeViewModel> {
  final TextEditingController? controller;
  const HomeViewDesktop({super.key, this.controller});

   @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, HomeViewModel viewModel) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: SizedBox(
          child: Row(
            children: [
              Column(
                children: [
                  ...
                  Row(
                    children: [
                      // #3: Pass controller to input field
                      InputField(controller: controller),
                      ...
                    ],
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// #2: Pass the controller to the Mobile layout
class HomeViewMobile extends ViewModelWidget<HomeViewModel> {
  final TextEditingController? controller;
  const HomeViewMobile({super.key, this.controller});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, HomeViewModel viewModel) {
    return Scaffold(

        body: ListView(
          children: [
            ...
            // #3: Pass controller to input field
            InputField(controller: controller),
            ...
          ],
        ),
    );
  }
}
```

And the last thing to do is to call the `captureEmail` function when the `NotifyButton` is tapped. Update your Mobile and Desktop layout to the following where you use the NotifyButton.

```dart
...
HomeNotifyButton(onTap: viewModel.captureEmail),
...
```

Then what we'll do is run `stacked generate` to update the generated code to the latest, then run the app again using `flutter run -d chrome`. Now type in an email or anything really, then tap the "Notify Me" button. You should see a dialog pop up with the value that you typed in like below.

<!-- ![Final Flutter Dialog on Web Screenshot](../images/085/08-final-dialog-screenshot.jpg) -->

### Bonus UI

The mouse cursor doesn't change when you hover over a button. To fix this simply add `.showCursorOnHover` at the end of your `NotifyButton` code in the widget.

```dart
class HomeNotifyButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final Function()? onTap;
  const HomeNotifyButton({Key? key, this.onTap}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: onTap,
      child: Container(
       ...
      ),
    ).showCursorOnHover; // <===== Hover extension
  }
}
```

Stacked has a few extensions you can checkout in `lib/extensions/hover_extensions.dart`

## Deploy to Firebase

And the last thing to do is to deploy to firebase. This has become so much easier than it use to be. If you have the firebase tools installed do:

<br/>

1. Run `firebase init`
2. Select `Hosting: Configure files for Firebase` option.
3. Select existing or create a new project
4. Set your public directory as `build/web`
5. Reply `Yes` to single page app question

And that's it. Now we run `flutter build web` then `firebase deploy --only hosting` and you're done ðŸš€ The video is coming soon, make sure to [subscribe on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/filledstacks?sub_confirmation=1).
